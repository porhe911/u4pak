**NOTE:** I've wrote an [alternative version](https://github.com/panzi/rust-u4pak)
of this in Rust and compiled a [self-contained binary](https://github.com/panzi/rust-u4pak/releases)
for Windows users. So there is no hassle with installing Python, plus it adds a
way to supply command line arguments via a file that you can associate with the
binary so you only need to double click that. It is also faster, mainly because
it uses multi-threading. (Note that it's command line arguments are sligthly
different.)

Basic usage:

    u4pak.py info <archive>                 - print archive summary info
    u4pak.py list <archive>                 - list contens of .pak archive
    u4pak.py test <archive>                 - test archive integrity
    u4pak.py unpack <archive>               - extract .pak archive
    u4pak.py pack <archive> <files>         - create .pak archive
    u4pak.py mount <archive> <mount-point>  - mount archive as read-only file system

For unpacking only unencryped archives of version 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 are supported,
for packing only version 1, 2, and 3.

**NOTE:** If you know (cheap) games that use other archive versions please tell me!
Especially if its 5 or 6. There is a change in how certain offsets are handled at
some point, but since I only have an example file of version 7 I don't know if it
happened in version 5, 6, or 7.

The `mount` command depends on the [llfuse](https://code.google.com/p/python-llfuse/)
Python package. If it's not available the rest is still working.

This script is compatible with Python 3.7.

If you get errors saying anything about `'utf8' codec can't decode byte [...]` try to
use another encoding by passing `--encoding=iso-8859-1` or similar.

If you get an error message about an illegal file magic try to pass `--ignore-magic`.
If you get an error message about the archive version being 0 try to pass
`--force-version=1` (or a higher number).

File Format
-----------

Byte order is little endian and the character encoding of file names seems to be
ASCII (or ISO-8859-1/UTF-8 that coincidentally only uses ASCII compatiple
characters).

Offsets and sizes seem to be 64bit or at least unsigned 32bit integers. If
interpreted as 32bit integers all sizes (except the size of file names) and offsets
are followed by another 32bit integer of the value 0, which makes me guess these
are 64bit values. Also some values exceed the range of signed 32bit integers, so
they have to be at least unsigned 32bit integers. This information was reverse
engineered from the Elemental [Demo](https://wiki.unrealengine.com/Linux_Demos)
for Linux (which contains a 2.5 GB .pak file).

Basic layout:

* Data Records
* Index
  * Index Header
  * Index Records
* Footer

In order to parse a file you need to read the footer first. The footer contains
an offset pointer to the start of the index records. The index records then
contain offset pointers to the data records.

Some games seem to zero out parts of the file. In particular the footer, which
makes it pretty much impossible to read the file without manual analysis and
guessing. I suspect these games have the footer included somewhere in the game
binary. If it's not obfuscated one might be able to find it using the file
magic (given that the file magic is even included)?

    end                        The last block can be smaller, of course.
